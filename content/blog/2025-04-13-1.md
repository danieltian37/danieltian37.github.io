yay finished personal website!!  
first time using cursor so this whole thing was basically vibe coded with the exception of some manual styling.  
not a whole lot of interesting stuff here but this is the first blog post!  

the photography page is quite broken and lowkey i get motion sick just scrolling through it but it's ok.  
someday i'll remove the placeholder text and put in more pictures right
